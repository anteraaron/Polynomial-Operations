# Polynomial-Operations  
    
A class that performs polynomial operations of 3 variables (e.g. x^2 + xy + y^2)

The PolyTerm class represents terms of a polynomial of 3 variables. It has fields  to store the coefficient of the term, and the exponents of variables x, y and z, respectively.
  
The Polynomial class stores polynomial with the terms of type <code>PolyTerm</code> and terms are ordered in canonical ordering (i.e. x^2 + xy + y^2).
  
The Original Code was made by our Professor Mr. Richard Bryann Chua and some methods were filled up by me. All credit goes to him :).
